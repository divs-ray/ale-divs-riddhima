Steps for merging the investment and morbidity file
Challenge
1. Data received in Stata format with value labels. In Stata, value label assigns a label to numeric values of a variable. While the values
appear to be in "string" form, the data type for the variable is preserved as "numeric". This helps in coding and reading the values.

In our dataset, "state" variable had value labels in investment file, and "muni" variable had value labels in the morbidity file. Thus, when we were reading
the stata file in python using pandas, the stata variable in investment data was read as string with its labels as values, and muni variable was read 
has the same issue in the morbidity file.

Solution
To fix this problem, we simply outsheeted our stata data as a csv file without labels using Stata. This solved our problem.

Once the files were read, we merged it on folio, state, muni, and wave variables.

#What works: # of columns are same, # of rows/observations--no

#I matched the first 16 rows with stata merge and python merge--they are similar

#But # of rows in python merge < # of rows/observations in stata merge

#Thus, something wrong is happening while merging, right now, don't want the problem is
